# gcc218-graphs

This repository contains all of my notes and codes while I was studying GCC218 (Algorithm in Graphs) at UFLA (Federal University of Lavras).

## Requirements

- `g++`
- `gdb` if you're debugging
- Just use any Linux distro or WSL on Windows (I personally use [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL))

## How to run

- I used VSCode to debug, so I just hit `F5` while in the active file
- If you're just here to run the files, just create a `makefile` file in the dir of the `.cpp` file you want to run based on [`makefile.example`](./makefile.example)
